# Lottery Data Analysis Demo1

## Project Description
This demo project showcases data manipulation and analysis using Python and pandas. It reads lottery draw data (including winning numbers and multipliers) from a CSV file and demonstrates how to:
- Parse and process lottery draw data
- Extract and analyze winning number frequencies by month
- Summarize multiplier information (e.g., count of draws, highest multiplier)
- Experiment with simple data transformations—all within a Jupyter Notebook environment

This project is intended as a starting point for exploring data science workflows with real-world data.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Python Environment:**
   Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv pythonEnv
   source pythonEnv/bin/activate  # On Windows: pythonEnv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas jupyter
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- **Using the Jupyter Notebook:**
  Launch the Jupyter Notebook to run and interact with the demo:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Open the `LotteryByTheNumbers.ipynb.ipynb` file to see example code that:
  - Loads the CSV data (e.g., `Lottery_Mega_Millions_Winning_Numbers__Beginning_2002.csv`)
  - Analyzes winning numbers by month
  - Extracts multiplier statistics

- **Running as a Script:**
  If you prefer running the analysis as a script, create a Python file (e.g., `analysis.py`) with the demo code and run:
  ```bash
  python analysis.py
  ```
